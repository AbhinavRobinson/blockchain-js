# Blockchain JS

This is a simple blockchain implimentation made in javascript using inbuilt crypto libraries.

I have used Typescript to ensure type safety, but it's not necessary.

## Installation

Use command `yarn install` or `npm i` to install dependencies.

- Node > 12.0.0 required.

## Run

Use command `yarn start` or `npm run start` to activate tsc compilation and node running index.js.

You can use command `yarn watch` or `npm run watch` to only run tsc -watch.

## Usage

I have layed out a sample usage in the end of the javascript/typescript file.

This is only intended for educational use.
